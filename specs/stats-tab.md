I want to build in bottom navigation to the Greenie app so that users can easily tap between major features.

The two most important features we will start with are League Home and Stats.

Each major feature should have its own icon and label in the bottom navigation bar

## League

The is the main home screen for each league in the Greenie app:

- See Basic information about their league
- Round schedule including next upcoming round highlighted
- Current league standings are clear and to the forefront
- App Bar should show name
- Ability to see other members
- Ability to see past league results
- League stats should take you to the Stats tab

## Stats

This is where users can go to see all stats about previous rounds, both their own and the leagues as a whole

- Initially shows your stats, but you can toggle to league stats
- Your stats include a large area of information about your previous rounds
- Handicap calculator
- Graphs and charts
- League stats include cumulative stats for the season
- League stats include who is doing the best at various things

## Other requirements

### Settings Menu
- We should have a screen for a settings menu
- Allows users to tweak both system settings, like theme, as well as Greenie-specific settings
- Accessed in the App Bar with a gear icon

### Other components
- The App Bar will show three things, an optional back button, the tab heading, and the settings menu button
- In the future, we will want to add many leagues to the app, and we'll want to think of how to handle that
